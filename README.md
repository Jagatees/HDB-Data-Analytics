# Maximizing Investment Returns in Singapore's HDB Resale Market

The Housing and Development Board (HDB) program, which has given Singaporeans access to high-quality public housing for decades, is largely responsible for the housing market in Singapore's distinctive combination of affordability and stability. However, the city-state has recently noticed a striking and enduring trend: the ongoing rise of HDB resale prices. This development has caused a fundamental reevaluation of property investment tactics, in order to take advantage of the booming real estate market.
