SkyPark was innovatively conceptualized to turn what would have been constraints being the inherent problems posed by a small plot of high density land in the city into an intelligent multi-layered architectural response. ... \r\n\r\nThe intention was to design houses in a residential tower. Experiencing the &#39;gardens&#39; from within the apartment, the space does actually create a &quot;grounded&quot; sensation, if not for the city skyline beyond.
