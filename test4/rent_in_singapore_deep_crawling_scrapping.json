Thanks. \r\n\r\nPropNex Associate Division Director \r\nCea Reg : R016315I Mobile / Whatsapp / Sms : +6593808038 \r\n\r\n\r\nSkyPark @ Somerset, \r\n22 St Thomas Walk\r\n4+1 bedrooms, 3,347sqft High floor,\r\nBungalow in the Sky Duplex layout, 800sqft Sky Garden on every floor, \r\nPrivate Balcony with Jacuzzi, \r\nindividual unit on each floor, \r\nHigh ceiling, Windy. \r\n\r\nPartial Furnished, \r\nasking $28k (Subject to GST)\r\nFully furnished can be arranged.\r\nAvailable 23rd Oct 23\r\n(Sample photos as shown) \r\n\r\nUncover the beauty of luxury living at its height. Luxurious way of living in a spacious duplex home, high above ground, surrounded by lush gardens of green and a backdrop of blue sky. \r\n\r\nThis 32 storey development, \r\ncomprising of 56 apartments, \r\nwill take your breath away every day with a stunning panoramic view of the surrounding city-view. \r\nA spacious sky terrace, a glass passenger lift, \r\na 40-metre swimming pool and a cigar terrace are fine touches to your abode, \r\nwhich has a ceiling height of six-metres. \r\n\r\nVertical living in Singapore can\u2019t get more exciting than this. SkyPark was innovatively conceptualized to turn what would have been constraints being the inherent problems posed by a small plot of high density land in the city into an intelligent multi-layered architectural response. ... \r\n\r\nThe intention was to design houses in a residential tower. Experiencing the &#39;gardens&#39; from within the apartment, the space does actually create a &quot;grounded&quot; sensation, if not for the city skyline beyond. The jury was very impressed by the way in which the architect was able to integrate these design strategies successfully to create meaningful spaces within a coherent piece of architecture. \r\n\r\nFacilities, \r\n40m Lap pool \r\nGym \r\nBBQ area \r\nFunction room \r\n24hrs security \r\nGolf bag storage '",
