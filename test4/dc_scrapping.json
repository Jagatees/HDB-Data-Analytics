SkyPark was innovatively conceptualized to turn what would have been constraints being the inherent problems posed by a small plot of high density land in the city into an intelligent multi-layered architectural response. ... \r\n\r\nThe intention was to design houses in a residential tower. Experiencing the &#39;gardens&#39; from within the apartment, the space does actually create a &quot;grounded&quot; sensation, if not for the city skyline beyond. The jury was very impressed by the way in which the architect was able to integrate these design strategies successfully to create meaningful spaces within a coherent piece of architecture. \r\n\r\nFacilities, \r\n40m Lap pool \r\nGym \r\nBBQ area \r\nFunction room \r\n24hrs security \r\nGolf bag storage '",
