Kembangan MRT is not &quot;that&quot; crowded. A bus outside the condo takes you about 3mins in/out to the MRT. \r\n\r\nI am a female landlord staying in the Condo with my mom (we are a pair of easy-going, simple and tidy family). \r\n\r\nI intend to rent out my Master Bedroom which also has its own Bathroom and Balcony to a nice single working lady! The room is furnished, include Wi-Fi, include utilities and weekly cleaning too! \r\n\r\nThe eastern part of Singapore is windy and its always nice to have a good workout stroll to the beach (20-30mins). Or challenge a cycle to Marina Bay? *The exercise path from this Condo is connected all the way to Marina Bay!\r\n\r\nRoom is available immediately. WA me for more chats @ 94879048.'",
